A Small Tamil Text-To-Speech tool for linux.

This application is based on a text to speech tool called flite_hts_tamil 
created by [mentamizh] (https://github.com/mentamizh/flite_hts_tamil)
which uses code from open source android app developed by [donlab]
(http://www.iitm.ac.in/donlab/tts/index.php)

Indian Robotics have added a simple script to generate speech from text effortlessly.

Theres also a windows version of KuttyTTS available from indianrobotics.org!

If you are a developer or wish to enhance this TTS,
Then checkout https://github.com/mentamizh/flite_hts_tamil

If you want a high quality, natural sounding tamil speech synthesizer, then you should definitely checkout **ArimaTTS**!

Ideas
=====

You can now build your own Tamil Voice-Enabled Applications in C/C++/Python/Java for linux using this command line tool (KuttyTTS).

Example Python Code (KuttyTTS.py)
===================
```python
import sys
import os

def speak(msg):
os.chdir('/home/indianrobotics/KuttyTTS')
speakCmd = "echo '"+msg+"' > kuttytts -m naveen_tamil.htsvoice -o output/speech.wav"
os.system(speakCmd)
os.system("aplay output/speech.wav")
return

speak("வணக்கம்")
```

Future :
========

* Graphical User Interface Will Be Added
* A C Shared-library will be created
* Python & Java API through wrappers
* A .Net library will be made available for Mono Developers

Pros
=====

* Light Weight & High Speed
* Easy To Install

Cons
=====

* Some speech processing problems & Letter-To-Sound rules should be fixed.
* Currently it has no intonation support, so sounds robotic.

Compiling from source :
